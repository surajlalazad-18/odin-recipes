  <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>
  <img src="../recipes-images/butter_chicken.webp" alt="">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Butter Chicken is a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced Indian curry made with tender pieces of chicken. The chicken is
    first marinated in yogurt and spices like turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala, then cooked in a tandoor or
    grilled
    for a smoky flavor. It’s then simmered in a buttery tomato-based gravy made with cream, butter, and spices.

    The sauce is smooth, slightly sweet, and packed with flavor. It's not too spicy, which makes it a favorite for
    people
    around the world. Butter Chicken is usually served with naan (Indian flatbread) or basmati rice.</p>
