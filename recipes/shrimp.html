<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shrimp, also known as prawns in many parts of India, is a popular seafood that’s quick to cook and full of flavor. In
Indian cuisine, shrimp is often prepared as a spicy and aromatic curry. The shrimp are cleaned and cooked in a rich
gravy made with onions, tomatoes, garlic, and a mix of spices like turmeric, red chili, cumin, and garam masala. Coconut
milk or tamarind may also be added depending on the region — especially in coastal areas like Kerala or Goa.

Shrimp curry can be served with rice or chapati and is known for its bold, tangy, and slightly sweet flavor that
perfectly complements the delicate taste of shrimp.</p>
